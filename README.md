Reversi in C

A joint project with another student (not sure he wants to be named here) completed at LMU Munich during the practical course 'Systems programming' (one requirement for extra credit was no memory leaks - I had so much fun with this one!). 

Access to the [Munich Scientific Network](https://www.lrz.de/services/netz/mobil/vpn_en/) is required to communicate with the server and send game commands. Once a successful connection has been established, the game can be played via [this web interface](http://sysprak.priv.lab.nm.ifi.lmu.de). Below are two sample screenshots:
